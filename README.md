## What's covered?

In this Project, I have learn:- 
- Project planning
- Software architecture theory
- Multi-module architecture
- Gradle for large-scale projects (version catalogs & convention plugins)
- Authentication systems (OAuth / token refresh)
- Offline-first development
- Dynamic feature modules
- Google Maps SDK
- Jetpack Compose in multi-module projects
- Wear OS development (Health services API, data sync, UI building)

## How do you run the project?

In order to run the project on your phone, you'll need to first clone it and then add two API keys for:
1. ... the Runique API (access granted after course purchase)
2. ... Google Maps (needs to be got from Google Cloud Console - instructions in the course)

Then simply include them in `local.properties`:
```
API_KEY=<RUNIQUE_API_KEY>
MAPS_API_KEY=<GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY>
```
Afterwards, build the project and you're ready to use it.
